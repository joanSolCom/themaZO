[This [is the story that [tells the tale of how Johnny [the Bear]T [was born in the Pyrenees]R. 

[How Johhny]SP, [the fearless bear]SP,]T [was born]R. 

[Today]SP [[there [are very few bears in the Pyrenees [but]SP, beforeS]SP, [[[large numbers]T lived amongst the mountains of the range that [extends all the way from [the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean Sea]R. 

[Shepherds]SP, charcoal burners]R]R]SP, woodcutters and hunters]T [also lived [[there. 

[The bears]T moved from [one valley to another]A... 

[one day]T [they]T [would be in [the Basque Country [and]SP another in Bearn or [they]T would travel from Catalonia to Aragon]R. 

[It]T [was not unusual on these journeys for a bear to get lost or be left behind]R. 

[One such bear]T [was once left behind [and]SP [cut off in a cave in misty weather]R]A]R]SP, [not very far from a shepherds ' [hut]SP. 

[Weeks]SP went]T by without the mist lifting and [the bear]T did]T n't [[dare [[risking falling down a precipice]R. 

[He]T [was sad]SP, [not being able to put up with the lack of company]R. 

[One morning]SP [he]T saw [[how [a woman]T had left the shepherds ' hut to look for wood]R. 

[The bear]T grabbed the woman and took her to his cave where]SP [he]T [placed an enormous rock to block its entrance]R. 

[After nine months a little boy]T [was born]R. 

[When]SP the little lad]T [was four years]SP old [he]T asked his mother]A, Mother]A,]R]R]SP [[[do n't you [want to see the world ? 

[His mother pointed to the big rock]R. 

[The child [pushed it aside with his left hand to open the cave entrance]R. 

[He]T [was only four [but]SP [hewas a very strong bear]R. 

[[[My son]SP, if]SP your]R]R]R]R father [comes back and [sees [what]R [you have done]SP, [he]T [will kill us both]R. 

[But]SP [the little bear]R took her to the nearest village]R. 

[And]SP Johnny]SP, [as [the bear]T [was called]R, [went to school]R. 

[And]SP all [the children laughed at him]SP, 

[[Your Daddy]T [is a bear ! 

[[Your Daddy]T [is a bear ! 

[[Johnny grabbed [one of them by the two legs and, using him as a big stick]SP, [gave [a good hiding [to all his schoolmates]R. 

[And]SP Johnny]T [said]R [to his mother]A, Mother]A, [I]T [am going to find out about the world]R. 

[But]SP, [[[my sonS]SP, [what]R [have you lost in the world ? 

[I]T [want to know fear]R, responded Johnny]R. 

[His mother]T consulted the teacher and the teacher [[told her]T : I]R]R]R ['ll teach [him fear]R. 

[And]SP [he]T took Johnny to a barn where [the teacher]T had a big box]R. 

[Open the box]SP, [the teacher]T ordered Johnny]R. 

[[[Johnny obeyed]R. 

[On opening the box a multitude of pigeons came out]SP, [beating their wings in the lad 's face]R. 

[The truth]T [was that Johnny [was a little surprised]R]A]R]SP. 

[Did n't that [frighten you ?]SP, [asked the [teacher]SP. 

[It]T [gave me a surprise]R, [but]SP it]T [did n't scare [me]SP. 

[And]SP [Johnny left the teacher]SP, [the school and his mother and [went to look for fear]R.
