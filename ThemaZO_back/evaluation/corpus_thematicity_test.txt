[In an Oct. 19 review of " The Misanthrope " at Chicago 's Goodman Theatre]SP1 ( [" Revitalized Classics]T1 [Take the Stage in Windy City , " Leisure & Arts ) , the role of Celimene , played by Kim Cattrall , was mistakenly attributed to Christina Haag]R1 .

[A record date]T1 has n't [been set]R1 . 

[Bell , based in Los Angeles ,]T1 [makes and distributes electronic , computer and building products]R1 . 

[Investors]T1 [are appealing to the Securities and Exchange Commission {not [to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

{[A SEC proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives]T1 [would [undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock - picking tool]R1}P1.1 , [individual investors and professional money managers]T1 contend]R1 . 

[They]T1 [make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer {[that]T1 , [among other things]SP1 , [would exempt many middle - management executives from reporting trades in their own companies ' shares]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[The proposed changes]T1 [also]SP1 [would allow {[executives]T1 [to report exercises of options later and less often]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Many of the letters]T1 [maintain {that [investor confidence]T1 has [been [so]SP1 shaken by the 1987 stock market crash-1 -- and the markets]T2 already so stacked against the little guy]R2 - 1 - that any decrease in information on insider - trading patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

["]R1 {[The SEC]T1 [has [historically]SP1 [paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field]R1}P1.1 , " wrote Clyde S. McGregor of Winnetka , Ill. , in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. 17]R1 . 

["]R1 Apparently [the commission]T1 did [not [really]SP1 believe in this ideal]R1 . ["]R1 

[Currently]SP1 , [the rules]T1 [force executives , directors and other corporate insiders {[to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

But [about 25 % of the insiders]T1 [, [according to SEC figures]SP1 , file their reports late]R1 . 

{[The changes]T1 [were [proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives " who are really calling the shots ,]R1}P1.1 " said Brian Lane , special counsel at the SEC 's office of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes]R1 . 

{[Investors , money managers and corporate officials]T1 [had until today to comment on the proposals , and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory]R1}P1.1 , [Mr. Lane]T1 said]R1 . 

{[The SEC]T1 [will [probably]SP1 [vote on the proposal early next year]R1}P1.1 , [he]T1 said]R1 . 

[Not all those who wrote]T1 [oppose the changes]R1 . 

[The Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities for the American Bar Association]T1 [argues , for example-1 - 1 , in its lengthy letter to the SEC , {that [the proposed changes]T1 " [would [substantially]SP1 improve the law by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 [-2]R1 

[What-1 the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most-2]T1 [is the effect that-1they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale " clusters " of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time]R1 . 

[According to some estimates]SP1 , [the rule changes]T1 [would cut insider filings by more than a third]R1 . 

[The SEC 's Mr. Lane]T1 [vehemently]SP1[ disputed those estimates]R1 . 

{[The proposed rules]T1 [also]SP1 [would [be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports]R1}P1.1 , [he]T1 said]R1 . 

[Companies]T1 would [be compelled {[to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

{[Considered as a whole-1]R1}P1.1 , Mr. Lane said , [the filings required under the proposed rules-2]T1 " [will be at least as effective , if not more so , for investors following transactions]R1 . ["]R1 

[Many investors]T1 [wrote {asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately , not a month later]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[But]SP1 [Mr. Lane]T1 [said {[that]SP1 while the SEC [regulates who files , [the law]T1 tells them when to do so]R1}P1.1 ]]R1 . 

{[Investors who want to change the required timing]T1 [should [write their representatives in Congress]R1}P1.1 , [he]T1 added]R1 . 

{[The SEC]T1 [would [likely]SP1 [be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis]R1}P1.1 , [he]T1 said]R1 . 

[The nation 's largest pension fund , which oversees $ 80 billion for college employees ,]T1 [plans {[to offer two new investment options to its 1.2 million participants]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement Equities Fund]T1 [said {[it]T1 [will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in " socially responsible " companies , and a bond fund]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Both funds]T1 [are expected {[to begin operation around March 1 , subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

{[For]SP1 [its employees]T1 [to sign up for the options]R1}P1.1 , [a college]T1 [also]SP1 [must approve the plan]R1 . 

[Some 4,300 institutions]T1 [are part of the pension fund]R1 . 

[The new " social choice " fund]T1 [will shun securities of companies linked to South Africa , nuclear power and in some cases , Northern Ireland]R1 . 

[Also]SP1 [excluded will be investments in companies with " significant " business stemming from weapons manufacture , alcoholic beverages or tobacco]R1 . 

[Sixty percent of the fund]T1 will [be invested in stocks , with the rest going into bonds or short - term investments]R1 . 

[The bond fund]T1 [will invest in high - grade or medium - grade bonds , mortgages or asset - backed securities , including as much as 15 % in foreign securities]R1 . 

[The fund]T1 [also]SP1 [might buy and sell futures and options contracts , subject to approval by the New York State Insurance Department]R1 . 

[Under two new features]SP1 , [participants]T1 [will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds-1 or , if their jobs are terminated , receive cash from the funds-2]R1 . 

[The investment choices offered by the pension fund]T1 [currently]SP1 [are limited to a stock fund , an annuity and a money - market fund]R1 . 

[New Brunswick Scientific Co. , a maker of biotechnology instrumentation and equipment ,]T1 [said {[it]T1 [adopted an anti - takeover plan giving shareholders the right to purchase shares at half price under certain conditions]R1}P1.1]R1 .

[Solo woodwind players]T1 [have {[to be creative]R1}P1.1 if they want to work a lot , because their repertoire and audience appeal are limitedP5]R1 . 

[Richard Stoltzman]T1 [has taken a gentler , more audience - friendly approach]R1 . 

[Years ago]SP1 , [he]T1 [collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi , which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen 's " Quartet for the End of Time]R1 " 

Today , [the pixie - like clarinetist]T1 [has [mostly]SP1 dropped the missionary work {though [a touch of the old Tashi]T1 [still]SP1[ survives and now goes on the road with piano , bass , a slide show , and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop , with a few notable exceptions]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Just]SP1 [the thing for the Vivaldi - at - brunch set , the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening]R1 . 

[But]SP1 [you]T1 ca [n't dismiss-1 Mr. Stoltzman 's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight-2]R1 . 

[He]T1 [believes in what he plays , and he plays superbly]R1 . 

[His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum , dubbed " A Musical Odyssey]T1 [, " was a case in point]R1 . 

[It]T1 [felt more like a party , or a highly polished jam session with a few friends , than a classical concert]R1 . 

{Clad in his trademark black velvet suit , [the soft - spoken clarinetist]T1 [announced that his new album , " Inner Voices , " had just been released , that his family was in the front row , and that it was his mother 's birthday]R1}P1.1 , [so]SP1 [he]T1 [was going to play her favorite tune from the recordP5]R1 . 

And [so]SP1 [it]T1 [went through the first half]R1 : an ingeniously [chosen potpourri of pieces , none longer than five minutes , none that would disturb or challenge a listener]R1 . 

[Mr. Stoltzman]T1 [introduced his colleagues : Bill Douglas , pianist / bassoonist / composer and an old buddy from Yale , and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez]R1 . 

[Bach 's " Air]T1 [" followed]R1 . 

{[[Mr. Stoltzman]T1 [tied the composer in by proclaiming him " the great improviser of the 18th century , " and]R1}P2 {[then]SP1 [built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two - part inventions , cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. Douglas]R1]R1}P3 . 

[The end of the first half]T1 [, [however]SP1 , brought {what [the standing - room - only crowd]T1 [seemed to be waiting for : the pop singer Judy Collins , who appears on " Inner Voices]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

{[Glamorous and pure - voiced as ever]R1}P1.1 , [Ms. Collins]T1 [sang Joni Mitchell 's " For Free " - about an encounter with a street - corner clarinetist , to which-1 Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas 's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing , " Deep Peace]R1 . ["]R1 [-2]R1 

["]R1 [Deep Peace "]T1 [also]SP1[ featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds , beaches , deserts , sunsets , etc]R1 . 

{[It]T1[ [was all too mellow to be believed , but]R1}P2 {[they]SP1[ [probably would have gotten away with it , had-1 they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins 's signature tune , " Amazing Grace , " and ask for audience participation-2P5]R1 .]R1}P3 

[That]T1 [went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings]R1 . 

[Was this {[why]SP1 [some of the audience]T1 [departed before or during the second half]R1}P1.1]R1 ? 

[Or]SP1 [was it]R1}P2]T1 [because]SP1 [Ms. Collins]T1 [had gone]R1]R1}P3]R1 ? 

[{[Either way]SP1 [it]T1 [was a pity ,]R1}P2]T1 [because]SP1 [Mr. Stolzman]T1 [offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission : Steve Reich 's " New York Counterpoint , " one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing]R1]R1}P3]R1 . 

[Mr. Reich 's new " Different Trains " for string quartet]T1 [uses the technique magisterially]R1 . 

[He]T1 [also [unfortunately]SP1 illustrated this intricate , jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson 's images , this time of geometric or repeating objects , in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich 's piece and Mr. Stoltzman 's elegant execution of it]R1 . 

[The rest of the concert]T1 [was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker , Ornette Coleman , Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez , with pictures for the Douglas pieces]R1 . 

[It]T1 [was enjoyable {[to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke - filled club]R1}P1.1 , but like the first half , much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable]R1 . 

[Is this the future of chamber music]R1 ? 

[Managers and presenters]T1 [insist {[that]SP1 [chamber music concerts]T1 [are a hard sell]R1}P1.1 , but can audiences really enjoy them only-2 if the music is purged of threatening elements , served up in bite - sized morsels and accompanied by visualsP5]R1 ? 

[What]T1 ['s next]R1 ? 

[Slides to illustrate Shostakovich quartets]R1 ? 

[It]T1 [was not an unpleasant evening , certainly , thanks to the high level of performance , the compositional talents of Mr. Douglas , and the obvious sincerity with which-1 Mr. Stoltzman chooses his selections-2]R1 . 

[But]SP1 [it]T1 [was neither deep nor lasting : light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of Brahms]R2]R1 . 

[Ms. Waleson]T1 [is a free - lance writer based in New York]R1 . 

[One of Ronald Reagan 's attributes as President]T1 [was {that [he]T1 [rarely]SP1[ gave his blessing to the claptrap that passes for " consensus " in various international institutions]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[In fact]SP1 , [he]T1 [liberated the U.S. from one of the world 's most corrupt organizations - UNESCO]R1 . 

[This]T1 [is the U.N. group that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education , science and culture]R1 . 

[Ever since]SP1 , [the remaining members]T1 [have been desperate for the United States to rejoin this dreadful group]R1 . 

[Now]SP1 [UNESCO apologists]T1 [are lobbying President Bush {[to renege on President Reagan 's decision to depart]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

{[[Mr. M'Bow]T1 [was an extreme case , but]R1}P2 {[even]SP1[ his replacement , the more personally genial Spanish biochemist Federico Mayor ,]T1 [has had little success at achieving reforms]R1 .]R1}P3 

[Several ridiculous projects-1]T1 [continue , including the " New International Economic Order , " which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else 's statism-2]R1 . 

[UNESCO]T1 [somehow]SP1[ converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into " peoples ' rights]R1 . ["]R1 

[Million - dollar conferences]T1 [were held {[to chew on subjects such as " ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament " and " the impact of the activities of transnational corporations]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

[The agency]T1 [was [so totally]SP1 subverted from the high principles of its founding {that [even the Soviets]T1 [now]SP1[ wonder about an agency that seemed so congenial to them]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Glasnost]T1 [may be partly responsible , but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted , " The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to UNESCO]R1 . ["]R1 

[UNESCO]T1 [is [now]SP1 holding its biennial meetings in Paris {[to devise its next projects]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

{[Mr. Mayor 's hope that references to " press freedom " would survive unamended]T1 [seems doomed to failure]R1}P1.1 ; the current phrasing [is " educating the public and media to avoid manipulation]R1 . ["]R1 

[He]T1 has [n't been able to replace the M'Bow cabal]R1 . 

[Soviets]T1 [remain in charge of education programs , a former head of an African military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture , and a hard - line Polish communist in exile directs the human - rights and peace division]R1 . 

[Of the agency 's 2,750 staff members , 230]T1 [are in the field {working on actual projects , such as literacy and oceanographic research]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[The position of the United States , which once contributed 25 % of the budget]T1 [, is {[that]SP1 [nothing]T1 [has changed]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[John Bolton , the assistant secretary of state for international organizations ,]T1 [told Congress {[that]SP1 [the continuing " statist , restrictive , nondemocratic " programs]T1 [make rejoining any time soon " extremely unlikely]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

[This]T1 has [n't [much]SP1 bothered the UNESCO delegates , who last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th - century French chateau the agency somehow owns]R1 . 

[Other countries , including West Germany ,]T1 [may have a hard time justifying continued membership]R1 . 

[This]T1 [is {[that]SP1 [the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square]T1 [shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Free markets , free minds and free elections]T1 [have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations - which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home]R1 . 

[The Babelists of the United Nations]T1 [are experts at obfuscation]R1 . 

[This]T1 [can have its purposes at times , but there 's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice]R1 . 

[We]T1 [can see plenty of reasons to stay out , and none to rejoin UNESCO]R1 . 

[Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium]T1 [said {[they]T1 [have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[The researchers]T1 [said {[they]T1 [have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Such so - called male - sterile plants]T1 can [then]SP1 [be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , {[thereby]SP1 [producing hybrid seed]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

["]R1 {[The development]T1 [could [have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton ,]R1}P1.1 " said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S.]R1 . 

On a commercial scale , [the sterilization of the pollen - producing male part]T1 has [only]SP1 [been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains]R1 . 

[That]T1[ [}P2]T1]R1['s [because]SP1 [the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear]T1 [, are some distance apart on the corn plant]R1]R1}P3]R1 . 

[In a labor - intensive process]SP1 , [the seed companies]T1 [cut off the tassels of each plant , {making it male sterile]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[They]T1 [sow a row of male - fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male - sterile plants]R1 . 

[The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach]T1 [were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinated plants]R1 . 

[The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop]T1 [now]SP1 [is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies]R1 . 

[A similar technique]T1 [is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice]R1 . 

{[[The male part , the anthers of the plant , and the female , the pistils , of the same plant]T1 [are within a fraction of an inch or]R1}P2 {[even]SP1 [attached to each other]R1]R1}P3 . 

[The anthers in these plants]T1 [are difficult to clip off]R1 . 

{[[In China]SP1 , [a great number of workers]T1 [are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers , and]R1}P2 {[one]SP1 [- third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds]R1 .]R1}P3 

[At Plant Genetic Systems]SP1 , [researchers]T1 [have isolated a pollen - inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility]R1 . 

[Jan Leemans , research director ,]T1 [said {[this gene]T1 [was [successfully]SP1 introduced in oil - producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a " promoter gene " developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[The sterilizing gene]T1 [is expressed {just [before]SP1 [the pollen]T1 [is about to develop]R1}P1.1 and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant]R1 . 

[Mr. Leemans]T1 [said {[this genetic manipulation]T1 does [n't hurt the growth of that plant]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[The researchers]T1 [also]SP1[ pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male - sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop]R1 . 

[They]T1 [attached a second gene , for herbicide resistance , to the pollen - inhibiting gene]R1 . 

[Both genes]T1 [are [then]SP1 inserted into a few greenhouse plants , which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed]R1 . 

[The laws of heredity]T1 [dictate {[that]SP1 [half of the plants springing from these greenhouse - produced seeds]T1 [will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[The application of herbicide]T1 [would kill off the male - fertile plants , {leaving a large field of male - sterile plants that can be cross - pollinated to produce hybrid seed]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Mr. Leemans]T1 [said {[the hybrid rapeseeds created with this genetic engineering]T1 [yield 15 % to 30 % more output than the commercial strains used currently]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

["]R1 [This technique]T1 [is applicable to a wide variety of crops , " he said , P3 and]R1 ] SP1 [he]T1 [added {[that]SP1 [some modifications]T1 [may be necessary to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[He]T1 [said {[the company]T1 [is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa , and plans to include cotton and corn , among other crops]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[He]T1 [said {[that]SP1 even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids , [the genetic approach]T1 [will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers , which costs U.S. seed producers about $ 70 million annuallyP5]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[In recent years]SP1 , [demand for hybrid seeds]T1 [has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co]R1 . 

[One technique developed by some of these companies]T1 [involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant 's pollen]R1 . 

[But]SP1 there [have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants ' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans , animals and beneficial insects]R1 . 

[However]SP1 , [Paul Johanson , Monsanto 's director of plant sciences ,]T1 [said {[the company 's chemical spray]T1 [overcomes these problems and is " gentle on the female organ]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

[Biosource Genetics Corp. , Vacaville , Calif. ,]T1 [is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen]R1 . 

[This gene , called " gametocide ,]T1 " [is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days]R1 . 

[Robert Erwin , president of Biosource ,]T1 [called Plant Genetic 's approach " interesting " and " novel , " and " complementary rather than competitive]R1 . ["]R1 

["]R1 {[There [is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds]R1}P1.1 , " [he]T1 said]R1 . 

[Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine , the seed producer in Scott , Miss. ,]T1 [said {[Plant Genetic 's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles]T1 does [n't [automatically]SP1 mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[That]T1 ['s P2because pollination , while easy in corn because the carrier is wind , is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton]R1 

["]R1 {[It]T1 ['s one thing to say you can sterilize , and another to then successfully pollinate the plant]R1}P1.1 , " [he]T1 said]R1 . 

[Nevertheless]SP1 , he said , [he]T1 [is negotiating with Plant Genetic {[to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[A bitter conflict with global implications]T1 [has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan , two of the world 's most powerful financial companies]R1 . 

[The clash]T1 [is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in Japan 's once - cozy financial circles]R1 . 

[Already]SP1 , [the consequences]T1 are [being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments]R1 . 

{[What]T1 [triggered the latest clash]R1}P1.1 was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue]R1 . 

[Nomura]T1 [was attempting {[to organize the 50 billion - yen ( $ 352 million ) borrowing in Japan at a time]R1}P1.1 when-1 many Japanese banks , led by Industrial Bank of Japan , were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand 's civil - service pension fund]R1 . 

{[Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid]R1}P1.1 , [most banks]T1 [refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing , forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week]R1 . 

[The dispute]T1 [shows clearly the global power of Japan 's financial titans]R1 . 

Aside from Nomura 's injured pride , [the biggest victim]T1 [so far]SP1 [has been the New Zealand government]R1 . 

{[Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues]R1}P1.1 , [Wellington 's Debt Management Office]T1 had [been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars ( US$ 1.76 billion ) to NZ$ 4 billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June 30]R1 . 

{[With]SP1 [Japan 's cash - flush banks]T1 [aligned against it , though]R1}P1.1 , raising money [may be difficult]R1 . 

[He]T1 [told reporters in Wellington Tuesday {[that]SP1 [the government]T1 had [n't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd. , an investment bank 80 % - owned by the National Provident Fund , and would n't bail it out]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

["]R1 {[It]T1 [may [very well]SP1 [be what-1 the Japanese banks want-2]R1}P1.1 , " [he]T1 told Radio New Zealand]R1 . 

[I]T1 [think {[it]T1 [would be irresponsible]R1}P1.1 and I am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests]R1 . ["]R1 

No less [significant than the Japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries]R1 . 

[Anxiety]T1 [is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other]R1 . 

{[[Both sides]T1 [are [jealously]SP1 guarding their turf , and]R1}P2 {[relations]SP1[ [have been at a flashpoint for months]R1 .]R1}P3 

[The banks]T1 [badly]SP1[ want {[to break into all aspects of the securities business]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Meanwhile]SP1 , [the securities companies - most of them smaller than the banks -]T1 [are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks]R1 . 

[Nomura , the world 's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field , and Industrial Bank of Japan , Japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad ,]T1 [captain the opposing sides]R1 . 

[And]SP1 [their suspicions of each other]T1 [run deep]R1 . 

[In the past year]SP1 , [both]T1 [have tried {[to stretch the limits of their businesses]R1}P1.1]R1 .

[Perhaps]R1 . 

But for the next few months , [these boys of summers]T1 [long past]SP1 [are going {to [be reveling in an Indian summer of the soul]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Now that the baseball season is officially over]SP1 , you [see , [it]T1 's time for a new season to begin]R1 . 

[Today]T1 [is the debut of the Senior Professional Baseball Association , a new eight - team pro sports circuit , modeled after the highly successful senior tennis and golf tours and complete with good salaries , a cable television contract and even expansion plans]R1 . 

[One hundred and ninety two former greats , near greats , hardly knowns and unknowns begin a 72 - game , three - month season in spring - training stadiums up and down Florida]R1 . 

[For everyone involved]SP1 , [it]T1 ['s one more swig of that elixir of youth , baseball]R1 . 

["]R1 {[Someone]T1 [always]SP1[ [makes you quit]R1}P1.1 , " says legendary St. Louis Cardinals centerfielder Curt Flood , the league 's commissioner]R1 . 

["]R1 [You]T1 [feel {[you]T1 [want one more -- one more at - bat , one more hit , one more game]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

{[Until]SP1 [the baby - faced heroes of today]T1 [reclaim these ballparks for spring training]R1}P1.1 , [there is one more]R1 . 

And [not [just]SP1 for the players]R1 . 

[It]T1 ['s one more {[for]SP1 [the baseball - loving lawyers , accountants and real estate developers who ponied up about $ 1 million each for the chance to be an owner ,]T1 [to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

["]R1 {[Nothing]T1 [can [be better than this]R1}P1.1 , " says Don Sider , owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics]R1 .

[Midmorning]SP1 , [he]T1 [dons an orange - and - blue uniform and , for fun , may field a bunt from Dave Kingman]R1 . 

[It]T1 ['s one more , too , for the fans who dream of a season that never ends]R1 . 

["]R1 {[I]T1 [feel like a little kid]R1}P1.1 , " says a gleeful Alex de Castro , a car salesman , who has stopped by a workout of the Suns to slip six Campaneris cards to the Great Man Himself to be autographed]R1 . 

[The league 's promoters]T1 [hope {[retirees and tourists]T1 [will join die - hard fans like Mr. de Castro and pack the stands to see the seniors]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[The league]T1 [is the brainchild of Colorado real estate developer James Morley - once a minor - leaguer himself - who says he had the idea last January while lying on a beach in Australia]R1 . 

{[When]SP1 [he]T1 [sent letters offering 1,250 retired major leaguers the chance of another season]R1}P1.1 , [730]T1 responded]R1 . 

[Eventually]SP1 , [about 250]T1 [made the trip to Florida {[to compete for the available slots]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

( [Players]T1 [have {[to be 35 or older , except for catchers , who are eligible at 32 because life behind the plate is so rough]R1}P1.1 .]R1 ) 

[For some players]SP1 , [the lure is money -- up to $ 15,000 a month]R1]T1 [. 

[Others , just released from the majors ,]T1 [hope {[the senior league]T1 [will be their bridge back into the big - time]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[But]SP1 {[as]SP1 [they]T1 [hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn , and relive old duels in the sun]R1}P1.1 [it]T1 's clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it -- or something close to it]R1 . 

["]R1 [My fastball]T1 [is good]R1 . 

[Real [good , " says 39 - year - old Pete Broberg , {working in the midday heat of the Tropics camp]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[For a long time]SP1 , [he]T1 [ignored baseball altogether , even the sports pages]R1 . 

[Now]SP1 [Mr. Broberg , a lawyer ,]T1 [claims {[he]T1 ['d play for free]R1}P1.1]R1 .

[The nagging memory of one afternoon]T1 [fourteen years ago]SP1 drove Jim Gideon , a lean 36 - year - old righthander to take a four - month leave from selling insurance in Texas to try out for Mr. Weaver 's team]R1 . 

["]R1 {[It]T1 does [n't [replace pitching in the majors , but it proves to me that I would have been able to playP5 if I 'd stayed healthyP6 ,]R1}P1.1 [" he]T1 says]R1 . 

Back in 1975 , [late in the season]SP1 , [a then - 21 Mr. Gideon]T1 [made his only major league appearance , five and two - thirds innings for the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox]R1 . 

[He]T1 [gave up seven hits , walked five and did n't get a decision]R1 . 

[Arm troubles]T1 [forced him back to the minors the next year]R1 . 

["]R1 {[There ['s a satisfaction in going against the rules]R1}P1.1 , " offers Will McEnaney , once a stopper with Cincinnati 's Big Red Machine]R1 . 

[He]T1 [means the rule that a player ca n't cut it after a certain age]R1 . 

[These days]SP1 [he]T1 [hustles to house - painting jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after training with the Tropics]R1 . 

{[While]SP1 [sipping a beer after practice]R1}P1.1 , [he]T1 [vividly]SP1 recounts getting the Red Sox 's Carl Yastrzemski to pop out to end the 1975 World Series , and repeating the feat against the Yankees ' Roy White in 1976]R1 . 

[Some of the game 's reigning philosophers]T1 [dislike the idea of middle - aged men attempting a young man 's sport]R1 . 

["]R1 [I]T1[ [personally]SP1 do [n't enjoy {seeing players who-1]R1}P1.1]R1 {[I]T1 [remember vividly from their playing days running about and being gallant about their deficiencies-2]R1}P1.1 , " says Roger Angell , New Yorker magazine 's resident baseball sage]R1 .

[Worse-1 , says baseball author Lawrence Ritter , {[" Someone]T1 [will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 [-2]R1

[Most]T1 [are trim]R1 . 

[No one]T1 [has worked out the players ' average age , but most appear to be in their late 30s]R1 . 

[And]SP1 [there 's pride]R1 . 

["]R1 {[I]T1 [' m not going to look stupid]R1}P1.1 , " vows former Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman Rennie Stennett , sweat dotting his brow as he prepares for some practice swings]R1 . 

["]R1 {[It]T1 ['s [going to be a tough league ,]R1}P1.1 " promises the 47 - year - old Mr. Campaneris]R1 . 

["]R1 There [will be a lot of malice]R1 . ["]R1 

{[Men who have played hard all their lives]T1 [are n't about to change their habits]R1}P1.1 , [he]T1 says]R1 . 

[Nonetheless]SP1[ , [one]T1 ca [n't help {}P1.1]R1wonder swhether the game will be just a little bit slower]R1 .

[So]SP1 [he]T1 [adjusts]R1 . 

[He]T1 [no longer]SP1 crowds the plate]R1 . 

[He]T1 ‘s [not thinking about home runs anymore , just base hits]R1 . 

[Still]SP1 , " [how]R1-1 [sweet-1 [it]T1 is-2 , " he says , savoring the fat sound of the well - hit line drive that bounces off the center field wall]R1-2 . 

{[And]SP1 do [n't [expect many complete games by pitchers -- perhaps three out of 288]R1}P1.1 , laughs Mr. Fingers , the former Oakland reliever]R1 .

{[Stuffing a wad of Red Man into his cheek]R1}P1.1 , [he]T1 [admits the fastball he brought into the majors in 1955 has become a slowball]R1 .

[In a surprise move]SP1 , [the British government]T1 [cleared the way for a bidding war for Jaguar PLC by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker]R1 . 

[Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley]T1 [told the House of Commons yesterday {[that]SP1 [he]T1 [will relinquish the government 's so - called golden share in the company as long as Jaguar shareholders agree]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[The golden share]T1 [restricts any individual holding to 15 % and expires at the end of 1990]R1 . 

{[It]T1 [was in Jaguar 's best interests " for the company 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible ,]R1}P1.1 [" Mr. Ridley]T1 said]R1 . 

Mr. Ridley 's [decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world 's auto giants for Britain 's leading luxury - car maker]R1 . 

[Both General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.]T1 have [been trying {[to amass 15 % stakes in Jaguar]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Ford , which already has an unwelcome 13.2 % holding ,]T1 [is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early]R1 . 

[GM]T1 has [been negotiating a friendly transaction with Jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30 %]R1 . 

[But]SP1 [the government 's action , which caught Jaguar management flat - footed ,]T1 [may scuttle the GM minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of Jaguar]R1 . 

[Many investors]T1 [certainly]SP1[ believe {[a bidding war]T1 [is imminent]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Jaguar shares]T1 [skyrocketed yesterday after Mr. Ridley 's announcement , {following their temporary suspension on London 's Stock Exchange]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[In late trading]SP1 , [the shares]T1 [were up a whopping 122 pence ( $ 1.93 ) -- a 16.3 % gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares]R1 . 

In the U.S. over - the - counter market , Jaguar shares trading [as]SP1 [American Depositary Receipts]T1 [closed at $ 13.625 , up $ 1.75]R1 . 

[Analysts]T1 [expect {[Ford]T1 [will make the first move , perhaps today , with an initial offer of about 900 pence ( $ 14.25 ) a share]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

Such a [proposal values Jaguar at more than # 1.6 billion ( $ 2.53 billion )]R1 . 

[Speculation about a takeover fight]T1 [has sent Jaguar shares {}P1.1]R1soaring in the past six weeks]R1 . 

[The share price]T1 [was languishing at about 400 pence before Ford 's Sept. 19 announcement of its interest in a minority stake]R1 . 

[An aggressive Ford bid for Jaguar]T1 [would put pressure on GM {[to make a better offer as the British company 's " white knight]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

[Such a countermove]T1 [could end Jaguar 's hopes for remaining independent and British - owned]R1 . 

[But]SP1 [it]T1 [is n't clear {[how]R1-1 [long-1 GM]T1 [would be willing to fight Ford for Jaguar-2]R1-2}P1.1]R1 . 

{Because of their longstanding rivalry , [GM]T1 [just]SP1[ " [wants to make sure Ford pays a huge packet for ( Jaguar )]R1}P1.1 , " said John Lawson , an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute]R1 . 

[People close to the GM - Jaguar talks]T1 [agreed {that [Ford]T1 [now]SP1 [may be able to shut out General Motors]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

["]R1 {[It]T1 's [either [going to be a shootout , or there only may be one player in town]R1}P1.1 , " [one person]T1 said]R1 . 

[Another person close to the talks]T1 [said , {[" It]T1 [is very hard to justify paying a silly price for Jaguar if an out - and - out bidding war were to start now]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

[In a statement]SP1 , [Jaguar 's board]T1 [said {[they]T1 " were [not consulted about the ( Ridley decision ) in advance and were surprised at the action taken]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

[The statement]T1 [emphasized {[that]SP1 [holders representing 75 % of the shares voting at a special shareholders ' meeting]T1 [must agree to lift the takeover restrictions]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Jaguar officials in the U.S.]T1 [noted {that [Ford]T1 [, as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , [now]SP1 has the power to call for such a meeting]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[U.S. auto analysts]T1 [also]SP1[ noted {[that]SP1 [Ford]T1 [is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[{[[Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid]T1 [are weakened , analysts add ,]R1}P2]T1 [because]SP1 [fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and management]R1]R1}P3]R1 . 

[Ford officials in the U.S.]T1 [declined {[to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[But]SP1 [GM officials]T1 [said {they , too , [were surprised by the move , which left them to " consider all our options and explore matters further]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

{[Although]SP1 [GM]T1 [has U.S. approval to buy up to 15 % of Jaguar 's stock]R1}P1.1 , [it]T1 has [n't [yet]SP1 disclosed how many shares-1 it now owns-2]R1 . 

[In a prepared statement]SP1 , [GM]T1 [suggested {[its plans for Jaguar]T1 [would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfalls investors might reap from a hostile Ford bid]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

["]R1 [Our intensive discussions with Jaguar , at their invitation]T1 , " GM [said , " have {[as]SP1 [their objectives]T1 [to create a cooperative business relationship with Jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great British car company , to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long - term return for its shareholders]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1 

[Jaguar]T1 [was shocked by Mr. Ridley 's decision ,]R1}P2]T1 [because]SP1 [management]T1 [had believed the government would n't lift the golden share without consulting the company first]R1]R1}P3]R1 . 

[Indeed]SP1 , [the government]T1 [is taking a calculated risk]R1 . 

[Mr. Ridley 's announcement]T1 [set off a howl of protests from members of the opposition Labor Party , who accused the Thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company]R1 . 

[The British government]T1 [retained the single golden share after selling its stake in Jaguar]R1 . 

[The Conservative government 's decision]T1 [may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election , expected in late 1991]R1 . 

["]R1 [It]T1 ['s now a very good time politically {[to get this over and done with]R1}P1.1 , " observed Daniel Jones , professor of motor industry management at the University of Cardiff in Wales]R1 . 

[The government , already buffeted by high interest rates and a slowing economy ,]T1 has [been [badly]SP1 hurt by last week 's shake - up in Mrs. Thatcher 's cabinet]R1 . 

[At the same time]SP1 , [the government]T1 did [n't want {[to appear to favor GM by allowing a minority stake that might preclude a full bid by Ford]R1}P1.1]R1 . 

[Mr. Ridley]T1 [hinted at this motive in answering questions from members of Parliament after his announcement]R1 . 

[He]T1 [said {[he]T1 [was giving up the golden share " to clear the way so the playing field is level between all contestants]R1}P1.1]R1 . ["]R1
