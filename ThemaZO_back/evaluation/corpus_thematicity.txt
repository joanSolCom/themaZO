[The proposed changes]T1 [also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often]R1 .

[The SEC 's Mr. Lane]T1 [vehemently disputed those estimates]R1 .

{[He]T1 [believes in {[what]T1 [he plays]R1}P3]R1}P2 , {[and]SP1 [he]T1 [plays superbly]R1}P3 .

[His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum , dubbed " A Musical Odyssey]T1 , " [was a case in point]R1 .

[It]T1 [felt more like a party , or a highly polished jam session with a few friends , than a classical concert]R1 .

[Clad in his trademark black velvet suit , the soft - spoken clarinetist]T1 [announced that {[his new album , " Inner Voices , "]T1 [had just been released]R1}P2 , that {[his family]T1 [was in the front row]R1}P3 , and that {{[it was his mother 's birthday]R1}P4 , {[so]SP1 [he]T1 [was going to play her favorite tune from the record]R1}P5]R1 .

[And]SP1 [[so it went]T1 [[through the first half]R1]T1 : [an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces , none longer than five minutes , none {[that]T1 [would disturb or challenge a listener]R1}P2]R1 .

[Mr. Stoltzman]T1 [introduced his colleagues : Bill Douglas , pianist / bassoonist / composer and an old buddy from Yale , and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez]R1 .

[Bach 's " Air "]T1 [followed]R1 .

[Mr. Stoltzman]T1 [tied the composer in by proclaiming him " the great improviser of the 18th century , " and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two - part inventions , cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. Douglas]R1 .

[The end of the first half]T1 , [however]SP1 , [brought {what [[the standing - room - only crowd]T1 [seemed to be waiting for : the pop singer Judy Collins , {[who]T1 [appears on " Inner Voices . "]R1}P3]R1]R1}P2]R1

[Glamorous and pure - voiced as ever , Ms. Collins]T1 [sang Joni Mitchell 's " For Free " - about an encounter with a street - corner clarinetist , {[to which]R1-1 [Mr. Stoltzman]T1 [contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas 's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing , " Deep Peace .

[Was this]T1 [why {[some of the audience]T1 [departed before or during the second half]R1}P2]R1 ?

[Or]SP1 [was it]T1 [because {[Ms. Collins]T1 [had gone]R1}P2]R1 ?

[{[Either way]SP1 [it]T1 [was a pity]R1}P2]T1 , [{[because]SP1 [Mr. Stolzman]T1 [offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission : Steve Reich 's " New York Counterpoint , " one of a series of Reich works {[that]T1 [juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing]R1}P4]R1}P3]R1 .

[Mr. Reich 's new " Different Trains " for string quartet]T1 [uses the technique magisterially]R1 .

[He]T1 [also unfortunately illustrated this intricate , jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson 's images , this time of geometric or repeating objects , in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure {[that]T1 [was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich 's piece and Mr. Stoltzman 's elegant execution of it]R1}P2]R1 .

[The rest of the concert]T1 [was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker , Ornette Coleman , Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez , with pictures for the Douglas pieces]R1 .

{[It was enjoyable]R1 [to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke - filled club]T1}P1, {[but like the first half]SP1, [much of it]T1 [was easy to take and ultimately forgettable]R1}P2 .

[Is this]T1 [the future of chamber music]R1 ?

[[Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium]T1 [said]R1]SP1 [they]T1 [have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops]R1 .

[[The researchers]T1 [said]R1]SP1 [they]T1 [have isolated a plant gene {[that]T1 [prevents the production of pollen]R1}P2]R1 .

[Such so - called male - sterile plants]T1 [can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed]R1 .

" [The development]T1 [could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton]R1 , " [[said]T1 [Murray Robinson , [president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary {[that]T1 [is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S.]R1}P2]R1]SP1 .

[On a commercial scale]SP1 , [the sterilization of the pollen - producing male part]T1 [has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains]R1 .

[That 's]T1 [[because]SP1 [the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear]T1 , [are some distance apart on the corn plant]R1]R1.

[In a labor - intensive process]SP1 , [the seed companies]T1 [cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile]R1 .

[They]T1 [sow a row of male - fertile plants nearby , {[which]T1 [then pollinate the male - sterile plants]R1}P2]R1 .

{[The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach]T1 [were introduced in the 1930s]R1}P2 {[and]SP1 [they]T1 [yielded as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinated plants]R1}P3.

[The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop]T1 [now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies]R1 .

[A similar technique]T1 [is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice]R1 .

[The male part , the anthers of the plant , and the female , the pistils , of the same plant]T1 [are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other]R1 .

[The anthers in these plants]T1 [are difficult to clip off]R1 .

{[In China]SP1, {[a great number of workers]T1 [are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers]R1}P2, {[and]SP1 [one - third of rice produced in that country]T1 [is grown from hybrid seeds]R1}P3.

[At Plant Genetic Systems]SP1 , [researchers]T1 [have isolated a pollen - inhibiting gene {[that]T1 [can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility]R1}P2]R1 .

[Jan Leemans , research director]T1 , [said]R1]SP1 [this gene]T1 [was successfully introduced in oil - producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a " promoter gene " developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles]R1 .

{[The sterilizing gene]T1 [is expressed {[just before]SP1 [the pollen]T1 [is about to develop]R1}P4]R1}P2 {[and]SP1 [it]T1 [deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant]R1}P3.

[[Mr. Leemans]T1 [said]R1]SP1 [this genetic manipulation]T1 [does n't hurt the growth of that plant]R1 .

[The researchers]T1 [also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male - sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop]R1 .

[They]T1 [[attached a second gene , for herbicide resistance]T1 , [to the pollen - inhibiting gene]R1]R1 .

[Both genes]T1 [are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants , {[which]T1 [are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed]R1}P2]R1 .

[The laws of heredity]T1 [dictate that {[half of the plants springing from these greenhouse - produced seeds]T1 [will be male sterile and herbicide resistant]R1}P2 {[and]SP1 [half]T1 [will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible]R1}P3]R1 .

[The application of herbicide]T1 [would kill off the male - fertile plants , leaving a large field of male - sterile plants {[that]T1 [can be cross - pollinated to produce hybrid seed]R1}P2]R1 .

[[Mr. Leemans]T1 [said]R1]SP1 [the hybrid rapeseeds created with this genetic engineering]T1 [yield 15 % to 30 % more output than the commercial strains used currently]R1 .

{" [This technique]T1 [is applicable to a wide variety of crops]R1 , " [[he]T1 [said]R1]SP1}P2, {P3 [and] SP1 [he added that]SP2 [some modifications may be necessary]R1 [to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop]T1}P3 .

[[He]T1 [said]R1]SP1 [the company]T1 [is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa , and plans to include cotton and corn , among other crops]R1 .

[He]T1 [said that {[{[even though]SP1 [virtually all corn seeds currently planted]T1 [are hybrids]R1}P3]T1 , [{[the genetic approach]T1 [will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers , {[which]T1 [costs U.S. seed producers about $ 70 million annually]R1}P5]R1}P4]R1}P2]R1 .

[In recent years]SP1 , [demand for hybrid seeds]T1 [has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co]R1 .

[One technique developed by some of these companies]T1 [involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant 's pollen]R1 .

[But]SP1 [there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants ' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans , animals and beneficial insects]R1 .

[However]SP1 , [[Paul Johanson, Monsanto 's director of plant sciences]T1 , [said]R1]SP2 [the company 's chemical spray]T1 [overcomes these problems and is " gentle on the female organ]R1 . "

[Biosource Genetics Corp. , Vacaville , Calif.]T1, [is developing a spray containing a gene {[that]T1 [spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes {[that]T1 [are responsible for producing pollen]R1}P3]R1}P2]R1 .

[This gene , called " gametocide]T1 , " [is carried into the plant by a virus {[that]T1 [remains active for a few days]R1}P2]R1 .

[Robert Erwin , president of Biosource]T1 , [called Plant Genetic 's approach " interesting " and " novel , " and " complementary rather than competitive]R1 . "

" [There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds]R1 , " [[he]T1 [said]R1]SP1 .

[[Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine , the seed producer in Scott , Miss.]T1 , [said]R1]SP1 [Plant Genetic 's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles]T1 [does n't automatically mean {[it would be simple]R1 [to create hybrids in all crops]T1}P2]R1 .

[That 's]T1 [{P2[because]SP1 [pollination , while easy in corn {[because]SP1 [the carrier]T1 [is wind]R1}P3]T1 , [is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton]R1}P2]R1 

" {[It 's one thing]R1 [to say you can sterilize]T1}P2 , {[and]SP1 [another]R1 [to then successfully pollinate the plant]T1}P3 , " [[he]T1 [said]R1]SP1 .

[Nevertheless]SP1 , [[he]T1 [said]R1]SP2 , [he]T1 [is negotiating with Plant Genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton]R1 .

[A bitter conflict with global implications]T1 [has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan , two of the world 's most powerful financial companies]R1 .

[The clash]T1 [is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in Japan 's once - cozy financial circles]R1 .

[Already]SP1 , [the consequences]T1 [are being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments]R1 .

[What [triggered]R1 [the latest clash]T1]T1 [was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue]R1 .

[Nomura]T1 [was attempting to organize the 50 billion - yen ( $ 352 million ) borrowing in Japan at a time {[when]R1-1 [many Japanese banks , led by Industrial Bank of Japan]T1 , [were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank {[that]T1 [had been owned by New Zealand 's civil - service pension fund]R1}P3]R1}P2]R1 .

[Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand {[until]SP1 [those debts]T1 [are repaid]R1}P2]SP1 , [most banks]T1 [refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing , forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week]R1 .

[The dispute]T1 [shows clearly the global power of Japan 's financial titans]R1 .

[Aside from Nomura 's injured pride]SP1 , [the biggest victim]T1 [so far has been the New Zealand government]R1 .

[Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues]SP1 , [Wellington 's Debt Management Office]T1 [had been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars ( US$ 1.76 billion ) to NZ$ 4 billion {[it]T1 [needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June 30]R1}P2]R1 .

[With Japan 's cash - flush banks aligned against it]SP1, [though]SP2 , [raising money]T1 [may be difficult]R1 .

[He]T1 [[told reporters in Wellington Tuesday]T1 [that {[the government]T1 [had n't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd. , an investment bank 80% - owned by the National Provident Fund , and would n't bail it out]R1}P2]R1]R1 .

" [It]T1 [may very well be]R1 [{[what]R1-1 [the Japanese banks]T1 [want]R1-2}P2]R1 , " [[he]T1 [told Radio New Zealand]R1]SP1 .

{[I think]T1 [it would be irresponsible]R1}P2 {[and]SP1 [I]T1 [am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests]R1}P3 . "

[No less significant than the Japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are]R1 [the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries]T1 .

[Anxiety]T1 [is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers {[that]T1 [now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other]R1}P2]R1 .

{[Both sides]T1 [are jealously guarding their turf]R1}P2 , {[and]SP1 [relations]T1 [have been at a flashpoint for months]R1}P3 .

[The banks]T1 [badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business]R1 .

[Meanwhile]SP1 , [[the securities companies - most of them smaller than the banks]T1 - [are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking {[that]T1 [would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks]R1}P2]R1 .

[Nomura , the world 's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field , and Industrial Bank of Japan , Japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad]T1 , [captain the opposing sides]R1 .

[And]SP1 [their suspicions of each other]T1 [run deep]R1 .

[In the past year]SP1 , [both]T1 [have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses]R1 .

[And]SP1 [Industrial Bank of Japan]T1 [[started up a London securities subsidiary {[that]T1 [[sells Japanese stocks]T1 [to non - Japanese institutions overseas]R1]R1}P2 , a move {[that]T1 [stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms]R1}P3]R1 .

[The New Zealand bond issue]T1 [simply has brought the two institutions face - to - face]R1 .

[ITEL CORP.]T1 [reported third - quarter earnings , {[which]T1 [were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in yesterday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates]R1}P2]R1 .

[On a pretax basis]SP1 , [Itel 's third - quarter earnings of 30 cents a share]T1 [were actually 7.14 % higher than the average of estimates]R1 .

[Raymond E. Ross , 53 years old , formerly group vice president , U.S. plastics machinery , at this machine tool , plastics machinery and robots concern]T1 , [was named senior vice president , industrial systems , succeeding David A. Entrekin , {[who]T1 [resigned Monday]R1}P2]R1 .

[John A. Conlon Jr. , 45]T1 , [was named a managing director at this investment - banking company]R1 .

[He]T1 [will be in charge of research , equity sales and trading , and the syndicate operation of Rothschild]R1 .

[Mr. Conlon]T1 [was executive vice president and director of the equity division of the international division of Nikko Securities Co]R1 .

[[As]SP1[Yogi Berra]T1 [might say]R1]SP1 , [it]T1 ['s deja vu all over again]R1 .

[Crouched at shortstop , Bert Campaneris , once Oakland 's master thief]T1 , [effortlessly scoops up a groundball and flips it to second]R1 .

[In the outfield]SP1 , [Paul Blair , the Orioles ' eight - time Gold Glove winner]T1 , [elegantly shags a fly]R1 .

[On the mound]SP1 , [former Red Sox great Luis Tiant , the wily master of 1,001 moves]T1 , [throws an off - speed strike]R1 .

[" Babies , kiddies , "]R1 [[growls]T1 [their manager - a fellow named Earl Weaver , {[who]T1 , [in a different time]SP1 , [handled four World Series teams and now handles the Gold Coast Suns]R1}P2]R1]SP1 .

[" Old - time kiddies , "]R1 [[he]T1 [says]R1]SP1 .

[Perhaps]R1 .

[[But]SP1 for the next few months]SP1 , [these boys of summers long past]T1 [are going to be reveling in an Indian summer of the soul]R1 .

[Now that {[the baseball season]T1 [is officially over]R1}P2]SP1 , [you see]SP2 , [it 's time for a new season to begin]R1 .

[Today]T1 [is the debut of the Senior Professional Baseball Association , a new eight - team pro sports circuit , modeled after the highly successful senior tennis and golf tours and complete with good salaries , a cable television contract and even expansion plans]R1 .

[One hundred and ninety two former greats , near greats , hardly knowns and unknowns]T1 [begin a 72 - game , three - month season in spring - training stadiums up and down Florida]R1 .

[For everyone involved]SP1 , [it]T1 ['s one more swig of that elixir of youth , baseball]R1 .

" [Someone always makes you quit]R1 , " [[says]T1 [legendary St. Louis Cardinals centerfielder Curt Flood , the league 's commissioner]R1]SP1 .

" [You]T1 [feel you want one more -- one more at - bat , one more hit , one more game]R1 . "

[{[Until]SP1 [the baby - faced heroes of today]T1 [[reclaim these ballparks]T1 [for spring training]R1]R1}P2]T1 , [{[there is one more]R1}P3]R1 .

[And]SP1 [not just for the players]R1 .

[It]T1 ['s one more for the baseball - loving lawyers , accountants and real estate developers {[who]T1 [ponied up about $ 1 million each for the chance to be an owner , to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers]R1}P2]R1 .

" [Nothing can be better than]R1 [this]T1 , " [[says]T1 [Don Sider , owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics]R1]SP1 .

[Early in the morning]SP1 [Mr. Sider , an estate lawyer]T1 , [pores over last wills and testaments]R1 .

[Midmorning]SP1 , [he]T1 [dons an orange - and - blue uniform and , for fun , may field a bunt from Dave Kingman]R1 .

[It]T1 ['s one more , too , for the fans {[who]T1 [dream of a season {[that]T1 [never ends]R1}P3]R1}P2]R1 .

" [[I]T1 [feel like a little kid]R1]R1 , " [[says]T1 [[a gleeful Alex de Castro]T1 , [a car salesman , {[who]T1 [has stopped by a workout of the Suns to slip six Campaneris cards to the Great Man Himself to be autographed]R1}P2]R1]R1]SP1 .

[The league 's promoters]T1 [hope {[retirees and tourists]T1 [will join die - hard fans like Mr. de Castro and pack the stands to see the seniors]R1}P2]R1 .

[The league]T1 [is the brainchild of Colorado real estate developer James Morley - [once a minor - leaguer himself - {[who]T1 [says {[he]T1 [had the idea last January while lying on a beach in Australia]R1}P3]R1}P2]R1 .

[{[When]SP1 [he]T1 [sent letters {[offering 1,250 retired major leaguers]T1 [the chance of another season]R1}P3]R1}P2]T1 , [{[730]T1 [responded]R1}P3]R1 .

[Eventually]SP1 , [about 250]T1 [made the trip to Florida to compete for the available slots]R1 .

( [Players]T1 [have to be 35 or older , except for catchers , {[{[who]T1 [are eligible at 32]R1}P3]T1 [{[because]SP1 [life behind the plate]T1 [is so rough]R1}P4]R1}P2]R1 . )

[For some players]T1 , [[the lure]T1 [is money -- up to $ 15,000 a month]R1]R1 .

[Others , just released from the majors]T1 , [hope {[the senior league]T1 [will be their bridge back into the big - time]R1}P2]R1 .

[But]SP1 [{[as]SP1 [they]T1 [hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn , and relive old duels in the sun]R1}P2]SP2 [it 's clear that]SP3 [most]T1 [are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that {[they]T1 [still have it -- or something close to it]R1}P3 .]R1

" [[My fastball]T1 [is good]R1]R1 .

[Real good]R1 , " [[says]T1 [39 - year - old Pete Broberg , working in the midday heat of the Tropics camp]R1]SP1 .

[For a long time]SP1 , [he]T1 [ignored baseball altogether , even the sports pages]R1 .

[Now]SP1 [Mr. Broberg, a lawyer]T1 , [claims {[he]T1 ['d play for free]R1}P2]R1 .

" [You ca n't give it up that easily]R1 , " [[he]T1 [says]R1]SP1 .

" [I]T1 [tried]R1 . "

[The nagging memory of one afternoon fourteen years ago]T1 [drove Jim Gideon , a lean 36 - year - old righthander to take a four - month leave from selling insurance in Texas to try out for Mr. Weaver 's team]R1 .

" {[It]T1 [does n't replace pitching in the majors]R1}P2 , {[but]SP1 [it]T1 [proves to me that {[{[I]T1 [would have been able to play]R1}P5]T1 [{[if]SP1 [I]T1 ['d stayed healthy]R1}P6]R1}P4]R1}P3 , " [[he]T1 [says]R1]SP1 .

[Back in 1975]SP1 , [late in the season]SP2 , [a then - 21 Mr. Gideon]T1 [made his only major league appearance , five and two - thirds innings for the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox]R1 .

[He]T1 [gave up seven hits , walked five and did n't get a decision]R1 .

[Arm troubles]T1 [forced him back to the minors the next year]R1 .

" [{[There 's a satisfaction in going against the rules]R1}P2]R1 , " [[offers]T1 [Will McEnaney, once a stopper with Cincinnati 's Big Red Machine]R1]SP1 .

[He]T1 [means the rule that {[a player]T1 [ca n't cut it after a certain age]R1}P2]R1 .

[These days]SP1 [he]T1 [hustles to house - painting jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after training with the Tropics]R1 .

[While sipping a beer after practice]SP1 , [he]T1 [vividly recounts getting the Red Sox 's Carl Yastrzemski to pop out to end the 1975 World Series , and repeating the feat against the Yankees ' Roy White in 1976]R1 .

[Some of the game 's reigning philosophers]T1 [dislike the idea of middle - aged men attempting a young man 's sport]R1 .

" [I]T1 [personally do n't enjoy seeing players {[who]R1-1 [I]T1 [remember vividly from their playing days running about and being gallant about their deficiencies]R1-2}P2]R1 , " [[says]T1 [Roger Angell , New Yorker magazine 's resident baseball sage]R1]SP1 .

" [I]T1 [feel {[people]T1 [should be allowed to remember players as they were]R1}P2]R1 . "

[Worse]R1-1 , [[says]T1 [baseball author Lawrence Ritter]R1]SP2 , [" {[Someone will get a heart attack]R1}P2 {[and]SP1 [that]T1 [will be the end of the whole story]R1}P3 . "]R1-2

[But]SP1 [the ballplayers]T1 [disagree]R1 .

[Most]T1 [are trim]R1 .

{[No one has worked out the players ' average age]R1}P2 , {[but]SP1 [most]T1 [appear to be in their late 30s]R1}P3 .

[And]SP1 [there 's pride]R1 .

" [[I]T1 ['m not going to look stupid]R1]R1 , " [[vows]T1 [former Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman Rennie Stennett , sweat dotting his brow as {[he]T1 [prepares for some practice swings]R1}P2]R1]SP1 .

" [[It]T1 ['s going to be a tough league]R1]R1 , " [[promises]T1 [the 47 - year - old Mr. Campaneris]R1]SP1 .

" [There will be a lot of malice]R1 . "

[Men {[who]T1 [have played hard all their lives]R1}P2]T1 [are n't about to change their habits]R1 , [[he]T1 [says]R1]SP1 .

[Nonetheless]SP1 , [one ca n't help wonder swhether {[the game]T1 [will be just a little bit slower]R1}P2]R1 .

[At the weatherbeaten Pompano Beach municipal stadium]SP1 , [Mr. Blair , the 45 - year - old former Oriole]T1 , [knows {[his power]T1 [is n't {[what]R1-1 [it]T1 [used to be]R1-2}P3]R1}P2]R1 .

[So]SP1 [he]T1 [adjusts]R1 .

[He]T1 [no longer crowds the plate]R1 .

[He]T1 [‘s not thinking about home runs anymore , just base hits]R1 .

[Still]SP1 , " [[how sweet]R1-1 [it]T1 [is]R1-2]R1 , " [[he]T1 [says]R1 , [savoring the fat sound of the well - hit line drive {[that]T1 [bounces off the center field wall]R1}P2]SP1]SP2 .

[And]SP1 [do n't expect many complete games by pitchers -- perhaps three out of 288]R1 , [[laughs]T1 [Mr. Fingers , the former Oakland reliever]R1]SP2 .

[Expect brushbacks but no beanballs]R1 , [[says]T1 [Mr. McEnaney]R1]SP1 .

[And]SP1 [expect slower fastballs]R1 .

" [[I]T1 ['m not so young anymore]R1]R1 , " [[concedes]T1 [the cigar - chomping , 48 - year - old Mr. Tiant]R1]SP1 .

" {[I]T1 [wo n't be throwing 90 mph]R1}P2 , {[but]SP1 [I]T1 [will throw 80 - plus]R1}P3 , " [[he]T1 [says]R1]SP1 .

[White - haired Pedro Ramos , at 54 the league 's oldest player and a pitcher - coach with the Suns]T1 , [has lost even more speed]R1 .

[Stuffing a wad of Red Man into his cheek]SP1 , [he]T1 [admits {[the fastball {[he]T1 [brought into the majors in 1955]T1}P3]T1 [has become a slowball]R1}P2]R1 .

[Its maximum velocity]T1 [is 72 mph]R1 .

[But]SP1 [he]T1 [is n't worried]R1 .

[He]T1 [will compensate with the guile learned from his years in the majors]R1 .

[He]T1 [has good control]R1 .

[He]T1 [will keep the ball down , move it around]R1 .

[After all]SP1 , [[he]T1 [says]R1]SP2 , " [[Even to make love]T1 , [[you]T1 [need experience]R1]R1]R1 .

[In a surprise move]SP1 , [the British government]T1 [cleared the way for a bidding war for Jaguar PLC by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker]R1 .

[Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley]T1 [[told the House of Commons yesterday]T1 [that {[he]T1 [will relinquish the government 's so - called golden share in the company as long as Jaguar shareholders agree]R1}P2]R1]R1 .

[The golden share]T1 [restricts any individual holding to 15 % and expires at the end of 1990]R1 .

[It]T1 [was in Jaguar 's best interests " for the company 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible , "]R1 [[Mr. Ridley]T1 [said]R1]SP1 .

[Mr. Ridley 's decision]T1 [fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world 's auto giants for Britain 's leading luxury - car maker]R1 .

[Both General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.]T1 [have been trying to amass 15 % stakes in Jaguar]R1 .

[Ford , {[which]T1 [already has an unwelcome 13.2 % holding]R1}P2]T1 , [is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early]R1 .

[GM]T1 [has been negotiating a friendly transaction with Jaguar {[that]T1 [likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30 %]R1}P2]R1 .

[But]SP1 [the government 's action , {[which]T1 [caught Jaguar management flat - footed]R1}P2]T1 , [may scuttle the GM minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of Jaguar]R1 .

[Many investors]T1 [certainly believe {[a bidding war]T1 [is imminent]R1}P2]R1 .

[Jaguar shares]T1 [skyrocketed yesterday after Mr. Ridley 's announcement , following their temporary suspension on London 's Stock Exchange]R1 .

[In late trading]SP1 , [the shares]T1 [were up a whopping 122 pence ( $ 1.93 ) -- a 16.3 % gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares]R1 .

[In the U.S. over - the - counter market]SP1 , [Jaguar shares trading as American Depositary Receipts]T1 [closed at $ 13.625 , {[up $ 1.75]R1}P2]R1 .

[Analysts]T1 [expect {[Ford]T1 [will make the first move , perhaps today , with an initial offer of about 900 pence ( $ 14.25 ) a share]R1}P2]R1 .

[Such a proposal]T1 [values Jaguar at more than # 1.6 billion ( $ 2.53 billion )]R1 .

[Speculation about a takeover fight]T1 [has sent Jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks]R1 .

[The share price]T1 [was languishing at about 400 pence before Ford 's Sept. 19 announcement of its interest in a minority stake]R1 .

[An aggressive Ford bid for Jaguar]T1 [would put pressure on GM to make a better offer as the British company 's " white knight]R1 . "

[Such a countermove]T1 [could end Jaguar 's hopes for remaining independent and British - owned]R1 .

[But]SP1 [it is n't clear]R1 [{[how long]R1-1 [GM]T1 [would be willing to fight Ford for Jaguar]R1-2}P2]T1 . 

[Because of their longstanding rivalry]SP1 , [GM]T1 [just " wants to make sure {[Ford]T1 [pays a huge packet for ( Jaguar )]R1}P2 , "]R1 [[said]T1 [John Lawson , an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute]R1]SP2 .

[People close to the GM - Jaguar talks]T1 [agreed that {[Ford]T1 [now may be able to shut out General Motors]R1}P2]R1 .

" {[It 's either going to be a shootout]R1}P2 , {[or]SP1 [there only may be one player in town]R1}P3 , " [[one person]T1 [said]R1]SP1 .

[[Another person close to the talks]T1 [said]R1]SP1 , " [{[It is very hard]R1 [to justify paying a silly price for Jaguar]T1}P2]T1 [{[if]SP1 [an out - and - out bidding war]T1 [were to start now]R1}P3]R1 . "

[In a statement]SP1 , [[Jaguar 's board]T1 [said]R1]SP2 [they]T1 " [were not consulted about the ( Ridley decision ) in advance and were surprised at the action taken]R1 . "

[The statement]T1 [emphasized that {[holders representing 75 % of the shares voting at a special shareholders ' meeting]T1 [must agree to lift the takeover restrictions]R1}P2]R1 .

[Jaguar officials in the U.S.]T1 [noted that {[Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder]T1 , [now has the power to call for such a meeting]R1}P2]R1 .

[U.S. auto analysts]T1 [also noted that {[Ford]T1 [is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares {[that]T1 [have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid]R1}P3]R1}P2]R1 .

[{[Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid]T1 [are weakened]R1}P2]T1 , [[analysts]T1 [add]R1]SP1 , [{[because]SP1 [fewer than 3 % of its shares]T1 [are owned by employees and management]R1}P3]R1 .

[Ford officials in the U.S.]T1 [declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting]R1 .

[But]SP1 [[GM officials]T1 [said]R1]SP2 [they , too]T1 , [were surprised by the move , {[which]T1 [left them to " consider all our options and explore matters further]R1}P2]R1 . "

[{[Although]SP1 [GM]T1 [has U.S. approval to buy up to 15 % of Jaguar 's stock]R1}P2]SP1 , [{[it]T1 [has n't yet disclosed {[how many shares]R1-1 [it]T1 [now owns]R1-2}P4]R1}P3]R1 .

[In a prepared statement]SP1 , [[GM]T1 [suggested]R1]SP2 [its plans for Jaguar]T1 [would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfalls {[investors]T1 [might reap from a hostile Ford bid]R1}P2]R1 .

" [Our intensive discussions with Jaguar , at their invitation]T1 , " [GM said]SP1 , " [have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with Jaguar {[that]T1 [would provide for the continued independence of this great British car company , to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long - term return for its shareholders]R1}P2]R1 .

[{[Jaguar]T1 [was shocked by Mr. Ridley 's decision]R1}P2]T1 , [{[because]SP1 [management]T1 [had believed {[the government]T1 [would n't lift the golden share without consulting the company first]R1}P4]R1}P3]R1 .

[The British government]T1 [retained the single golden share after selling its stake in Jaguar]R1 .

" [It 's now a very good time politically]R1 [to get this over and done with]T1 , " [[observed]T1 [Daniel Jones , professor of motor industry management at the University of Cardiff in Wales]R1]SP1 .

[The government , already buffeted by high interest rates and a slowing economy]T1 , [has been badly hurt by last week 's shake - up in Mrs. Thatcher 's cabinet]R1 .

[At the same time]SP1 , [the government]T1 [did n't want to appear to favor GM by allowing a minority stake {[that]T1 [might preclude a full bid by Ford]R1}P2]R1 .

[Mr. Ridley]T1 [hinted at this motive in answering questions from members of Parliament after his announcement]R1 .

[[He]T1 [said]R1]SP1 {[he]T1 [was giving up the golden share " to clear the way]R1}P2 {[so]SP1 [the playing field]T1 [is level between all contestants]R1}P3 . "
