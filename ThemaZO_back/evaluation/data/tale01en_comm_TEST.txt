[This]T1 [is the story that tells the tale of how Johnny the Bear was born in the Pyrenees]R1. 

[How]R1-1 [Johhny, the fearless bear]T1, [was born]R1-2. 

[Today]SP1 [there are very few bears in the Pyrenees but, [before]SP2, large numbers lived amongst the mountains of the range that extends all the way from the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean Sea]R1. 

[Shepherds, charcoal burners, woodcutters and hunters]T1 [also]SP1[ lived there]R1. 

[The bears]T1 [moved from one valley to another ...]R1 

[one day]SP1 [they]T1 [would be in the Basque Country and another in Bearn or they would travel from Catalonia to Aragon]R1. 

[It]T1 [was not unusual on these journeys {[for]SP1 [a bear]T1 to [get lost or be left behind]R1}P1.1]R1. 

[One such bear]T1 [was [once]SP1 left behind and cut off in a cave in misty weather, not very far from a shepherds' hut]R1. 

[Weeks]T1 [went by without the mist lifting and the bear didn't dare risking falling down a precipice]R1. 

[He]T1 [was sad, {[not being able to put up with the lack of company]R1}P1.1]R1. 

[One morning]SP1 [he]T1 [saw {[how]R1-1 [a woman]T1 [had left the shepherds' hut to look for wood]R1-2}P1.1]R1. 

[The bear]T1 [grabbed the woman and took her to his cave where he placed an enormous rock to block its entrance]R1. 

[After nine months]SP1 [a little boy]T1 [was born]R1. 

{When the little lad [was four years old [he]T1 asked his mother, Mother]R1}P1.1, [don't [you]T1 want to see the world]R1 ? 

[His mother]T1 [pointed to the big rock]R1. 

[The child]T1 [pushed it aside with his left hand {[to open the cave entrance]R1}P1.1]R1. 

[He]T1 [was only four but he was a very strong bear]R1. 

[My son]SP1, [if]SP1 [your father]T1 [comes back and sees what you have done]R1}P2]R1 [{, [he]T1 [will kill us both]R1]R1}P3]T1. 

[But]SP1 [the little bear]T1 [took her to the nearest village]R1. 

[And]SP1 [Johnny, as the bear was called]T1 [, went to school]R1. 

[And]SP1 [all the children]T1 [laughed at him]R1, 

[Your Daddy]T1 [is a bear]R1 ! 

[Your Daddy]T1 [is a bear]R1 ! 

[Johnny]T1[ [grabbed one of them by the two legs and, {using him as a big stick]R1}P1.1, gave a good hiding to all his schoolmates]R1. 

[And]SP1 [Johnny]T1 [said to his mother, Mother {, [I]T1 [am going to find out about the world]R1}P1.1]R1. 

But, [my sonS]SP1, what [have [you]T1 lost in the world]R1 ? 

{[I]T1 [want to know fear]R1}P1.1, responded Johnny]R1. 

[His mother]T1 [consulted the teacher and the teacher told her : I'll teach him fear]R1. 

[And]SP1 [he]T1 [took Johnny to a barn where the teacher had a big box]R1. 

{[Open the box]R1}P1.1, [the teacher]T1 [ordered Johnny]R1. 

[Johnny]T1 [obeyed]R1. 

[On opening the box]SP1 [a multitude of pigeons]T1 [came out, {beating their wings in the lad's face]R1}P1.1]R1. 

[The truth]T1 [was {[that]SP1 [Johnny]T1 [was a little surprised]R1}P1.1]R1. 

Didn't [[that]T1 frighten you ?, asked the teacher]R1. 

[It]T1 [gave me a surprise, but it didn't scare me]R1. 

[And]SP1 [Johnny]T1 [left the teacher, the school and his mother and went to look for fear]R1.
